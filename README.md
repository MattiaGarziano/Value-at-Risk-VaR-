This repository contains two programs designed for calculating portfolio risk metrics: Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). The two programs use different methodologies to assess risk.

The first program calculates VaR using the parametric approach, assuming that portfolio returns follow a normal distribution. It takes as input an Excel file containing the daily returns of portfolio securities, the portfolio weights, and a confidence level such as 95% or 99%. The program outputs the annualized VaR based on the portfolio's mean return, standard deviation, and the critical Z-score corresponding to the specified confidence level. Additionally, it generates a graphical representation of the daily returns distribution, highlighting the VaR threshold.

The second program calculates CVaR using the historical approach, which relies on the actual distribution of portfolio returns rather than assuming a specific theoretical distribution. It takes the same inputs as the first program: an Excel file with daily returns, portfolio weights, and a confidence level. The output includes the annualized CVaR, computed as the average loss beyond the VaR threshold, and a visual representation of the daily returns distribution. This visualization includes both the VaR threshold and the CVaR daily point.

While the parametric approach provides a quick estimation of risk under normal market conditions, the historical method offers a more robust analysis by capturing extreme losses directly from historical data.

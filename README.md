This repository contains two programs designed for calculating portfolio risk metrics: Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). The two programs use different methodologies to assess risk.
The first program calculates VaR using the parametric approach, assuming that portfolio returns follow a normal distribution. It takes as input an Excel file containing the daily returns of portfolio securities, the portfolio weights, and a confidence level such as 95% or 99%. The program outputs the annualized VaR based on the portfolio's mean return, standard deviation, and the critical Z-score corresponding to the specified confidence level. Additionally, it generates a graphical representation of the daily returns distribution, highlighting the VaR threshold.
